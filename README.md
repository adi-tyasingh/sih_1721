problem statement id: **SIH_1721**                                                                                                
Ministry: **Ministry of Youth and Sports**                                                                                       

Background: Effective intelligence and investigative capabilities are essential for uncovering and addressing doping violations. Current methods often lack the sophistication needed to keep up with evolving doping strategies. enhancing these capabilities through advanced technologies can significantly improve the National Anti-Doping Agency's ability to detect, investigate, and act upon doping violations. 

Description: The above problem statement envisages the designing of a comprehensive intelligence and investigation system to enhance NADA's ability to detect, investigate, and act upon doping violations. The solution should integrate multiple data sources and provide robust analytical tools, enabling proactive and reactive measures against doping. 

### Key Objectives: 

- Data Integration: Combine data from various sources, including testing results, athlete biological passports, and third-party information, to create a comprehensive database.
- Advanced Analytics: Utilize advanced analytics and AI to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of doping. 
- Actionable Intelligence: Generate actionable intelligence to guide investigations and enforcement actions, ensuring timely and effective responses to doping violations.

### Detailed Requirements
- Centralized Database Develop a secure and scalable database to store and manage data from diverse sources. Ensure the database supports real-time data updates and access controls.
- Data Sources Integrate data from testing results, athlete biological passports, medical records, and other relevant sources. Include external data sources such as social media, financial transactions, and travel records to provide a holistic view.
- Analytical Tools Implement AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze data and identify suspicious patterns. Develop predictive models to assess the risk of doping among athletes. Provide visualization tools to help investigators understand and interpret complex data.
- Investigation Management Create a user-friendly interface for investigators to track and manage cases. Include features for case documentation, evidence management, and collaboration among investigators. Develop automated reporting tools to generate comprehensive investigation reports.
- Confidential Communication Establish secure communication channels for whistleblowers and confidential informants. Ensure anonymity and protection of informant's identities.
- Training and Resources Provide training for investigators on the use of the new system and analytical tools. Develop a resource library with guidelines, best practices, and case studies on anti-doping investigations.

Expected Solution: A centralized and comprehensive intelligence and investigation system. Enhanced ability to detect and investigate doping violations using advanced analytics. Improved coordination and efficiency in managing doping cases. Increased protection for whistleblowers and informants, encouraging more reports of doping activities.

## Our solution:

### Data Storage:
- A comprehensive Database to store all components of Athlete Data.
  -  Past Performances
  -  Sports
  -  Medals
  -  Competition History
  -  Biologicals metrics
-  Scraping athlete performace data from websites like world athletics organisation.

### Flagging Mechanism: 
- A Completely Autonomous Reporting System.
- Machine learning model to flag possible dopers on the basis of past performances.
- Flagging based on large variations in biological metrics.

### Case Management: 
- A role based access control mechanism to protect athlete data privacy, with roles:
  - Admin
  - Investigator
  - Laboratory
  - Analyst
- Case allotment and management system with features for communicating between diffrent departments (eg. investigator to lab).

Final status: During the hackathon, due to issues with implementation of the RBAC and issues with hardware, we were unable to implement many of our proposed features, but work is ongoing and we intend to finish this project, with all of the above listed features implemented.
